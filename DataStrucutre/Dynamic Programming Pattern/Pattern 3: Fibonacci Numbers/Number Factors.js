/* 
Problem Statement #
Given a number ‘n’, implement a method to count how many possible ways there are to express ‘n’ as the sum of 1, 3, or 4.

Example 1:

n : 4
Number of ways = 4
Explanation: Following are the four ways we can exoress 'n' : {1,1,1,1}, {1,3}, {3,1}, {4} 
Example 2:

n : 5
Number of ways = 6
Explanation: Following are the six ways we can express 'n' : {1,1,1,1,1}, {1,1,3}, {1,3,1}, {3,1,1}, 
{1,4}, {4,1}

    if (n == 2) return 1; // we can subtract 1 twice to get zero and that is the only way
