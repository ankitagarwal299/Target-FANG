/* 
Problem Statement #
Given a number sequence, find the minimum number of elements that should be deleted to make the remaining sequence sorted.

Example 1:

Input: {4,2,3,6,10,1,12}
Output: 2
Explanation: We need to delete {4,1} to make the remaing sequence sorted {2,3,6,10,12}.
Example 2:

Input: {-4,10,3,7,15}
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to delete {10} to make the remaing sequence sorted {-4,3,7,15}.
Example 3:

Input: {3,2,1,0}
Output: 3
Explanation: Since the elements are in reverse order, we have to delete all except one to get a 
sorted sequence. Sorted sequences are {3}, {2}, {1}, and {0}

 /* 
 Alternately, we can convert this problem into a Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. As we know that LIS will give us the length of the longest increasing subsequence (in the sorted order!), which means that the elements which are not part of the LIS should be removed to make the sequence sorted. This is exactly what we need. So weâ€™ll get our solution by subtracting the length of LIS from the length of the input array: Length-of-input-array - LIS() */
